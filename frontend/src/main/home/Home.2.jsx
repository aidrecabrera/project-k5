                  Natural disasters have always been a part of our history,
                  etched into the very fabric of our nation. Typhoons,
                  earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and floods are realities that
                  we have faced for generations. Yet, climate change is
                  rewriting the rules of this ancient story. It is exacerbating
                  the impact of these natural events, making them more frequent
                  and more destructive.
